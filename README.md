# Send data to DfE: Data provider hub prototype

## About

The data provider hub (DPH) allows data providers and internal Department for Eduction colleagues to view and interact with data which has been captured through the Send data to DfE API.

## Users

The primary user groups for the DPH are:

- Schools
- Local authorities
- Internal colleagues

To better match the needs of these user groups the DPH allows for roles and delegation options.
